Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

    "body": "2019/01/25 - Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world.

He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life. I’ve been through fire and water, I tell you! From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them.  So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave.

    "body": "2019/01/21 - Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

    "body": "2019/01/19 - Social media has emerged as a powerful tool for activism, enabling marginalized communities to find their voices, raise awareness, and advocate for change. The LGBTQ+ community has harnessed the potential of social media platforms to create a global movement, fostering solidarity, challenging stereotypes, and fighting for equal rights. Raising Awareness and Visibility: Social media has provided LGBTQ+ individuals and organizations with a platform to share their stories, experiences, and challenges. Through personal narratives, educational content, and impactful visuals, social media campaigns raise awareness about LGBTQ+ issues and bring them to the forefront of public consciousness. By amplifying these voices, social media helps to increase visibility, break down stigmas, and foster empathy and understanding. Building Online Communities: Social media platforms have given rise to vibrant online communities where LGBTQ+ individuals can connect, support one another, and find a sense of belonging. From Facebook groups and Twitter chats to dedicated forums and subreddits, these digital spaces provide a safe haven for discussions, resource-sharing, and mutual encouragement. They empower individuals to express their identities, ask questions, and seek guidance from those with shared experiences. Advocacy and Mobilization: Social media serves as a catalyst for LGBTQ+ activism, facilitating rapid mobilization and the dissemination of information. Hashtags such as #LGBTQRights, #LoveIsLove, and #TransRightsMatter have galvanized movements, sparked conversations, and drawn attention to pressing issues. Activists leverage social media platforms to organize protests, rallies, and events, creating a global network of advocates working towards common goals. Engaging with Influencers and Allies: Influencers and allies play a crucial role in leveraging social media for LGBTQ+ activism. Influential individuals with large followings can use their platforms to promote LGBTQ+ rights, challenge discriminatory practices, and encourage their audiences to become allies. By engaging with these influencers and forging partnerships with supportive allies, the LGBTQ+ community expands its reach and influences societal attitudes on a broader scale. Impacting Legislative Change: Social media activism has proven instrumental in shaping legislative change and policy reform. Online campaigns have put pressure on lawmakers, garnered public support, and mobilized voters around LGBTQ+-specific issues. Through petitions, targeted messaging, and online advocacy initiatives, social media has helped achieve significant advancements in LGBTQ+ rights around the world. In conclusion, social media has revolutionized LGBTQ+ activism, offering a powerful platform for raising awareness, building communities, advocating for change, engaging with influencers and allies, and impacting legislative reform. By utilizing social media strategically, the LGBTQ+ community continues to harness its collective strength, fostering a more inclusive and equitable society for all. "

    "title": "The Impact of LGBTQ+ Representation in Tech",
    "body": "2019/01/18 - In recent years, the importance of representation has become a prominent topic of discussion across various industries, including the field of technology. In particular, the impact of LGBTQ+ representation in the tech industry cannot be underestimated. Breaking Stereotypes and Inspiring Others: LGBTQ+ representation in tech breaks stereotypes and challenges the prevailing notion that certain identities are incompatible with success in the field. By showcasing LGBTQ+ individuals thriving in various tech roles, we inspire others who may have felt marginalized or excluded. Seeing someone like themselves succeed in the industry can encourage aspiring LGBTQ+ technologists to pursue their passions, creating a more diverse and inclusive talent pool. Fostering Inclusive Work Environments: Having LGBTQ+ individuals represented in tech companies is crucial for fostering inclusive work environments. It sends a strong message that diversity and acceptance are valued within the organization. When employees can bring their authentic selves to work, without fear of discrimination or prejudice, they are more likely to feel a sense of belonging and perform at their best. LGBTQ+ representation can also lead to the development of LGBTQ+-friendly policies, such as gender-inclusive restrooms, inclusive healthcare coverage, and supportive employee resource groups. Driving Innovation and Creativity: Diversity fuels innovation, and LGBTQ+ representation in tech brings fresh perspectives and ideas to the table. LGBTQ+ individuals often have unique insights and experiences that can contribute to solving complex problems and generating innovative solutions. By embracing diverse voices and perspectives, tech companies can tap into a wealth of creativity, leading to the development of products and services that better serve the needs of all users, including the LGBTQ+ community. Enhancing User Experiences: LGBTQ+ representation in tech positively impacts user experiences. When LGBTQ+ individuals are involved in product design, development, and testing, they can bring awareness to specific needs and challenges faced by the community. This can result in the creation of more inclusive and user-friendly technologies. From LGBTQ+-friendly dating apps to platforms that prioritize privacy and safety for marginalized users, representation ensures that products and services cater to diverse identities and experiences. Building LGBTQ+ Communities and Networks: Representation in tech creates opportunities for LGBTQ+ individuals to connect, network, and support each other. It helps build communities where professionals can share experiences, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on projects. LGBTQ+ representation in conferences, meetups, and tech events fosters a sense of belonging and provides spaces for community building, mentorship, and professional growth. In conclusion, LGBTQ+ representation in the tech industry has a profound impact. It promotes inclusivity, inspires future generations, drives innovation, enhances user experiences, and builds supportive communities. By embracing and celebrating LGBTQ+ voices, we create a tech industry that is not only more diverse and representative but also more innovative and responsive to the needs of all individuals. "
